Electrochemotherapy has proven to be highly effective in the treatment of cutaneous metastases. Electrochemotherapy utilises pulses of electricity to increase the permeability of the cell membrane and thereby augment the effect of chemotherapy. For the drug bleomycin, the effect is enhanced several hundred-fold, enabling once-only treatment. The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of electrochemotherapy as a palliative treatment. Methods. This phase II study is a collaboration between two centres, one in Denmark and the other in the UK. Patients with cutaneous metastases of any histology were included. Bleomycin was administered intratumourally or intravenously followed by application of electric pulses to the tumour site. Results. Fifty-two patients were included. Complete and partial response rate was 68% and 18%, respectively, for cutaneous metastases <3 cm and 8% and 23%, respectively, for cutaneous metastases >3 cm. Treatment was well-tolerated by patients, including the elderly, and no serious adverse events were observed. Conclusions. ECT is an efficient and safe treatment and clinicians should not hesitate to use it even in the elderly.","Background.

Methods We studied blood pressure in 471 nine-year-old Indian children whose placental length, breadth and weight were measured in a prospective birth cohort study. Results In the daughters of short mothers (<median height), systolic blood pressure (SBP) rose as placental breadth increased (β = 0.69 mmHg/cm, p = 0.05) and as the ratio of placental surface area to birthweight increased (p = 0.0003). In the daughters of tall mothers, SBP rose as the difference between placental length and breadth increased (β = 1.40 mmHg/cm, p = 0.007), that is as the surface became more oval. Among boys, associations with placental size were only statistically significant after adjusting for current BMI and height. After adjustment, SBP rose as placental breadth, area and weight decreased (for breadth β = −0.68 mmHg/cm, p < 0.05 for all three measurements). Conclusions The size and shape of the placental surface predict childhood blood pressure. Blood pressure may be programmed by variation in the normal processes of placentation: these include implantation, expansion of the chorionic surface in mid-gestation and compensatory expansion of the chorionic surface in late gestation.","Aim: To determine whether the size and shape of the placental surface predict blood pressure in childhood.

Phosphate supplementation is time-consuming and the phosphate level might be dangerously low before normophosphatemia is re-established. This study evaluated the possibility to prevent hypophosphatemia during CRRT treatment by using a new commercially available phosphate-containing dialysis fluid. Methods Forty-two heterogeneous intensive care unit patients, admitted between January 2007 and July 2008, undergoing hemodiafiltration, were treated with a new Gambro dialysis solution with 1.2 mM phosphate (Phoxilium) or with standard medical treatment (Hemosol B0). The patients were divided into three groups: group 1 (n=14) receiving standard medical treatment and intravenous phosphate supplementation as required, group 2 (n=14) receiving the phosphate solution as dialysate solution and Hemosol B0 as replacement solution and group 3 (n=14) receiving the phosphate-containing solution as both dialysate and replacement solutions. Results Standard medical treatment resulted in hypophosphatemia in 11 of 14 of the patients (group 1) compared with five of 14 in the patients receiving phosphate solution as the dialysate solution and Hemosol B0 as the replacement solution (group 2). Patients treated with the phosphate-containing dialysis solution (group 3) experienced stable serum phosphate levels throughout the study. Potassium, ionized calcium, magnesium, pH, pCO2 and bicarbonate remained unchanged throughout the study.
