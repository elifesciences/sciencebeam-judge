        <p>Background. Cutaneous metastases may cause considerable discomfort as a consequence of ulceration, oozing, bleeding and pain. Electrochemotherapy has proven to be highly effective in the treatment of cutaneous metastases. Electrochemotherapy utilises pulses of electricity to increase the permeability of the cell membrane and thereby augment the effect of chemotherapy. For the drug bleomycin, the effect is enhanced several hundred-fold, enabling once-only treatment. The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of electrochemotherapy as a palliative treatment. Methods. This phase II study is a collaboration between two centres, one in Denmark and the other in the UK. Patients with cutaneous metastases of any histology were included. Bleomycin was administered intratumourally or intravenously followed by application of electric pulses to the tumour site. Results. Fifty-two patients were included. Complete and partial response rate was 68% and 18%, respectively, for cutaneous metastases 3 cm and 8% and 23%, respectively, for cutaneous metastases 3 cm. Treatment was well-tolerated by patients, including the elderly, and no serious adverse events were observed. Conclusions. ECT is an efficient and safe treatment and clinicians should not hesitate to use it even in the elderly.</p>

      <p>
        A cutaneous metastasis can be defined as ?a
neoplastic lesion arising from another neoplasm with which
there is no longer continuity? [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ]. Cutaneous
metastases account for 0.7% to 9% of all metastases [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ].
Breast cancer accounts for 51% of the total cases of
cutaneous metastases, while malignant melanoma
accounts for 18% [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>The management of cutaneous metastases often
presents a challenge for the clinician as they may be
widespread and may recur after radiotherapy or
chemotherapy. In some cases, patients may have stable
disease in sites other than the skin, and clinicians
may be reluctant to use systemic chemotherapy for
the skin metastases alone.</p>
      <p>
        Electrochemotherapy (ECT) is a rapidly
emerging and effective treatment option for cutaneous
metastases from malignant tumours [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4 ref5 ref6">4?6</xref>
        ]. ECT uses
local application of short duration, electric pulses
directly to the tumour cells via an electrode, causing
destabilisation of the cell membrane and thereby
making it transiently permeable
(electropermeabilisation ? Figure 1) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        ]. Bleomycin, a
chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of cancer, is under
normal conditions unable to freely diffuse through
the plasma membrane. However,
electropermeabilisation allows this otherwise poorly permeating agent
to enter the cell cytosol, thereby greatly increasing
its concentration within the tumour cell (Figure 2).
In high concentrations, such as those achieved with
ECT, bleomycin can cause cell death within a few
minutes [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ]. Preclinical studies have demonstrated a
300- to 700- fold increase in bleomycin cytotoxicity
using this method of drug delivery [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref11 ref9">9?11</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        ECT was originally employed for treatment of
metastatic head and neck cancer [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
        ] and has since
been used in the treatment of cutaneous metastases
from tumours independent of histology [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref14 ref5">5,13,14</xref>
        ].
ECT can be used where surgery is not an option and
is also efficient in chemotherapy-resistant and
radiotherapy-resistant lesions [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref5">5,15</xref>
        ]. Treatment may
provide palliation particularly where there is pain or
bleeding from cutaneous metastases [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
        ]. It is well
tolerated with few side-effects, allows for immediate
recovery and can be repeated [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4 ref5">4,5</xref>
        ]. In 2006 a
European study was published (the ESOPE study)
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
        ] and with that the standard operating procedures
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
        ] which describe the ECT procedures in detail.
      </p>
      <p>The present study aims at continuing the
exploration of ECT as a highly effective treatment in order to
improve and evaluate its benefits.To this end, we created
the International Network for Sharing Practice in
ElectroChemoTherapy (INSPECT) database, the purpose
of which is to gather, share and publish clinical data and
experience. This is the first report from this network.</p>

        <title>Study design</title>
        <p>Patients were recruited consecutively at two
institutions: Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev,
Denmark and James Cook University Hospital,
Middlesbrough, UK. The primary endpoint was
response rate. Secondary endpoints included safety
and response rate according to size.</p>
        <p>Patients at Herlev Hospital with cutaneous
metastases, for whom no further surgery or conventional
treatment was feasible, could be offered treatment
with ECT within the framework of a non-randomised
phase II study. Approval was granted by the local
ethics committee and the Danish Medicines Agency.</p>
        <p>Approval in the UK was granted in 2007 by the
clinical effectiveness subcommittee for treatment of
metastatic skin and subcutaneous lesions, palliation
of bleeding or painful lesions and primary
treatment of cancers not amenable to surgical excision or
conventional treatments.</p>
        <p>Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were
sequentially enrolled and all patients signed informed
consent before inclusion.</p>
        <p>Patients eligible for inclusion had histologically
proven malignant cancer with measurable cutaneous
or subcutaneous tumour nodules suitable for
application of electric pulses. Patients had been offered
standard treatment options, were 18 years old,
had ECOG performance status 2, had an expected
life expectancy of at least three months and, where
appropriate, were using adequate contraception. A
platelet count 50 mia/l was required, with a
prothrombin time 40 s and an activated partial
thromboplastin time in the normal range.</p>
        <p>Patients were ineligible if they had previously
had allergic reactions to bleomycin or to any of the
components required for anaesthesia, if the
cumulative dose of 250 mg bleomycin/m2 (400.000 IU
bleomycin/m2) had previously been exceeded, had chronic
renal dysfunction (serum creatinine 150 ?mol/l) or
acute lung infection.</p>
        <p>Follow-up was planned for up to six months.
Patients who had been started on systemic
antineoplastic treatment after ECT were excluded from the
study at that time.</p>

        <p>
          The ECT sessions were performed based on the
standard operating procedures for
electrochemotherapy [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
          ]. Bleomycin was administrated either
intratumourally (i.t.) or intravenously (i.v). The
decision to treat either i.t. or i.v. was based on the
number of cutaneous metastases to be treated and
the size of the metastases.
        </p>
        <p>General anaesthesia, was preferred for multiple
metastases, large metastases ( 3 cm), metastases
adhering to the periosteum or situated in sensitive
regions (e.g. face and scalp), and in accordance with
patient preference.</p>

activity of the drug and the manufacturer). Pulses
were delivered 8?28 minutes following injection

(ECT) was tailored to the patient?s condition, the
position of the lesions, the extent of treatment and the
special considerations pertaining to general
anaesthesia and the use of bleomycin [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
          ].
        </p>
        <p>Depending on the clinician?s choice, one of the
following electrodes was used: 1) Type I electrodes:
two plates with a 6 mm gap between the plates; 2)
Type II electrodes: two parallel rows of needles with
4 mm between the rows; 3) Type III electrodes: a
hexagonal array of electrodes with 7.9 mm between the
needles.</p>
        <p>Electric pulses (eight pulses of 100 ?s duration)
were delivered using a square wave electroporator
(IGEA, Carpi, Italy).The applied voltage was 1.3 kV/
cm for plate electrodes and 1.0 kV/cm for needle
electrodes, i.e. for the type II needle electrode with
a 4 mm gap between the needles the applied voltage
was 400 V. For type I and II electrodes, the pulses
are applied with 1 Hz or 5 kHz, whereas for type III
electrodes, pulses can only be applied with 5 kHz.
Electrodes were single use. The duration of the
procedure was recorded from the start of the bleomycin
injection to the completed delivery of the last pulse.
After ECT, the treated metastases were covered with
standard dressings where necessary.</p>

        <title>Tumour response and safety assessment</title>
        <p>
          Evaluation of the tumour response was by
measurement of the extension or regression of the treated
metastases. This was documented using digital
photography. A maximum of seven cutaneous
metastases per patient were registered as target lesions
in order not to skew data by inclusion of patients
with very large numbers of cutaneous metastases.
The response was registered for each target lesion
and new cutaneous metastases were not considered
in response evaluation but could be treated in a
second ECT session. The response rate was
evaluated similarly to the Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumours (RECIST version 1.0) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
          ]:
Complete response (CR) was defined as
disappearance of the target lesion; partial response (PR) with
at least 30% decrease in the diameter of the target
lesion; progressive disease (PD) with at least 20%
increase in the diameter of the target lesion and
stable disease (SD) with neither sufficient shrinkage
to qualify for PR or sufficient increase to qualify for
PD. In some cases with exophytic ulcerated tumours
evaluation was not possible due to crust formation
(Figure 3).
        </p>
        <p>Safety was reported in the form of adverse events
using Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0. Patients
were asked if they would potentially agree for another
session as a measure of how patients felt about the
treatment procedure.</p>

          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref11 ref9">9?11</xref>
          ].When
electric pulses are delivered to tissue in the presence of
bleomycin, the cell membrane becomes permeable and
bleomycin enters the cell where it is trapped.The large
increase in bleomycin cytotoxicity makes it possible to
do ?once-only? treatment suitable for the palliative
patient. The clinical effectiveness of ECT was first
demonstrated in head and neck squamous cell tumour
nodules in 1991 [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>
          ]. Subsequent clinical investigation
has shown that ECT using bleomycin is also a feasible
and effective treatment for cutaneous and
subcutaneous metastases of other malignancies [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
          ].

          The ESOPE study in 2006 [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
          ] produced
standard operating procedures for ECT treatment
(including dosage, pulse parameters, electric pulse
generators and electrodes), pain control and
indications for treatment. The ESOPE study demonstrated
that electrochemotherapy is an easy, highly effective
and safe treatment for small ( 3 cm) cutaneous or
subcutaneous metastases of various malignancies.
The objective response rate after one treatment
was 85%. Similar results have been demonstrated
by Campana et al. [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
          ] and additionally by many
case-reports and smaller studies [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23 ref24 ref25">23?25</xref>
          ].

        <title>Electrochemotherapy in routine use</title>
        <p>In the present study we have tried to manage
cutaneous metastases with ECT as a routine procedure in
two cancer centres. The primary endpoint of this
study was response rate.</p>
        <p>
          Fifty one patients from Denmark and the UK
were treated for 192 cutaneous metastases with
ECT ? the majority with either malignant melanoma
or breast cancer. This is in agreement with breast
cancer being the most common malignancy with
cutaneous metastases in women and malignant
melanoma being the most common in men [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
          ].
        </p>
        <p>ECT treatment in this study was provided as a
palliative procedure to patients with performance status
2. A broad spectrum of patients was included, which
is reflected in six patients lost to follow-up before any
evaluation and only 24 patients having a follow-up 60
days. Some patients travelled long distances to reach the
centre offering ECT which hindered follow-up, and
some patients had systemic progression during follow-up
and were offered other antineoplastic treatment. These
factors may explain the relative high rate of patients lost
to follow-up before any evaluation and only 47% of
patients having a follow-up period 60 days.</p>
        <p>
          The classic RECIST criteria [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
          ] were unsuitable
as tumour assessment in evaluation of ECT treatment
as RECIST includes measurable lesions in other organs
if present, a minimum size of 1 cm and a maximum
five lesions per organ. Also the aim of ECT is local and
not systemic control. Instead, the definitions of CR,
PR, PD and SD from RECIST were adapted and
seven cutaneous metastases were registered as target
lesions. This seems a feasible way to evaluate ECT.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this study, objective response rate (OR) for
patients with a follow-up period of 60 days was 86%
for cutaneous metastases 3 cm and 31% for
cutaneous metastases 3 cm. The metastases were divided
into smaller or larger than 3 cm to enable comparison
with previous studies. The response rate for the
cutaneous metastases 3 cm is similar to the ESOPE [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
          ]
and other studies [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref23 ref24">13,23,24</xref>
          ], whereas for larger
metastases, the OR is considerably lower, which is in
agreement with previous observations [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
          ]. In patients
with large volume disease, the purpose is not
necessarily to eradicate the cutaneous metastases, but to
obtain palliative relief in terms of decreased odour,
exudate and bleeding. Therefore, SD can be the aim
of ECT treatment for large volume disease. However,
in the management of small cutaneous metastases,
control and disappearance of cutaneous metastases
can be the aim of treatment. Due to the low incidence
of complications, treatment can be repeated several
times in order maintain local control or obtain control
if not achieved by the first treatment. In this study 11
of the 51 patients were resubmitted for treatment,
either due to new metastases or progression of
previously treated metastases, with no SAE?s observed.

        <title>ECT and its place in oncological practice</title>
        <p>For patients with cutaneous metastases, local control
during their remaining life period is the goal of
treatment. Regional and local techniques such as palliative
surgery, re-irradiation, hyperthermia, isolated limb
perfusion and isolated limb infusion can be offered to
patients with cutaneous metastases in order to provide
local symptom control. When offering treatment to
patients, the risk of complications and toxicity should
always be carefully addressed and the likely benefit
should always be compared with the risks to the patient.
Electrochemotherapy offers a minimally invasive local
treatment with swift symptomatic relief and few
sideeffects. ECT can also, as shown in this study with 48%
of patients being 70 years, be offered to elderly patients
for whom other treatments may not be a possibility.</p>
        <p>In this study, treatment was performed at two
different centres ? a department of plastic surgery
and a department of oncology ? with similar results.
This demonstrates that the treatment functions
well in different types of units. ECT may easily be
implemented as limited training is needed.</p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>In conclusion, our results in concordance with
previous studies suggest ECT is an efficient treatment that
may improve quality of life in patients with
metastatic disease and clinicians should not hesitate to use
it even for elderly patients. ECT is simple to
administer, and can therefore be implemented by smaller
hospital units with resultant benefits for patients.</p>
      <p>In our two centres, we concurrently found ECT
to be an excellent treatment choice for the patient
suffering from cutaneous metastasis where other
treatments have failed.</p>
      <p>We would recommend that more centres offer
ECT and that referral for this once-only and simple
treatment should be considered.</p>
