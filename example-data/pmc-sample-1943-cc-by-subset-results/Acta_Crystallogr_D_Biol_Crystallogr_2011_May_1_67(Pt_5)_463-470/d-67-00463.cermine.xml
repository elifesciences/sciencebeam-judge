      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>
        A crucial aspect of macromolecular crystallographic studies is
finding suitable conditions for the crystallization of a sample.
This can be difficult because many factors alter the
crystallization behaviour of macromolecules, including the type and
the concentration of the chemicals employed to formulate the
conditions
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(McPherson, 1990)</xref>
        . A condition includes at least
a precipitant and most conditions also include a buffer and an
additive. During the initial crystallization experiments, the
structure of the macromolecule is not known and hence the
most efficient formulation cannot be predicted. As a
consequence, one should be cautious when making initial
assumptions and limiting choices in subsequent optimizations
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">(Rupp,
2003)</xref>
        . Nonetheless, the number of initial crystallization
conditions cannot be unreasonably large since purified protein is
often difficult and expensive to produce in large quantities.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are essentially two approaches to restrict an initial
screen to a limited number of crystallization conditions. Firstly,
a sparse-matrix formulation can be used, which consists of
an empirically derived combination of components based on
known or published crystallization conditions
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(Jancarik &amp;
Kim, 1991)</xref>
        . Secondly, an incomplete factorial formulation can
be generated in which selected components are combined
to prepare new conditions in accordance with principles
of randomization and balance
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(Carter &amp; Carter, 1979)</xref>
        .
Numerous commercial screens based on these two main
approaches are available. Automated systems have been
implemented at the Medical Research Council (MRC)
Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) to test these as
routine initial screens using the 96-well crystallization plate
format
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(Stock et al., 2005)</xref>
        . However, for various reasons, many
laboratories opt for a minimal screen
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(Kimber et al., 2003)</xref>
        and still perform at least some aspects of the work manually
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Bergfors, 2007)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, we present a development based on the incomplete
factorial formulation: the Pi sampling method. The name of
the method was inspired by the story of Archimedes, who used
the ?method of exhaustion? (i.e. an empirical approach) with a
96-sided polygon in order to reach the first good numerical
approximation of
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(Smith, 1958)</xref>
        . Pi sampling uses modular
arithmetic to form combinations of three stock solutions
across a 96-condition grid. Maximally diverse conditions can
be produced by taking into account the properties of the
chemicals used in the formulation and the concentrations of
the corresponding stock solutions. We have implemented this
approach in a web-based application called Pi Sampler: user
input consists of the details of up to 36 stock solutions, from
which the application generates the formulations for a
96-condition screen. The Pi sampling method is intended to
help laboratories to test new crystallization-screen
formulations on a day-to-day basis based on the properties of the
macromolecules investigated, as has been performed
previously with RNA
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(Doudna et al., 1993)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>Firstly, we tested Pi sampling with ten commercially
available soluble proteins. For this, the ?Pi minimal screen? was
employed including a wide variety of well known chemicals
frequently used for macromolecular crystallization.</p>
      <p>
        We then investigated the impact of Pi sampling on the
crystallization of a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that
had been difficult to crystallize: the adenosine A2A receptor
(construct A2AR-GL31). We formulated another Pi screen, the
?Pi-PEG screen?, taking into consideration general
observations made about crystallization of integral membrane-protein
samples. Previous crystallization experiments on another
GPCR (the 1-adrenergic receptor) had indicated that the use
of simple proprietary screens formulated with poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) and buffers gave a greater yield of crystals than
all commercially available screens, including those geared
towards membrane proteins
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">(Warne et al., 2009)</xref>
        , and the 2.7 A?
resolution structure was solved using conditions optimized
from a proprietary screen essentially based on PEGs
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">(Warne
et al., 2008)</xref>
        . This has been observed previously with other
membrane-protein targets
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">(Lemieux et al., 2003)</xref>
        . In addition,
mixtures of polyethylene glycols have been used successfully
to develop a minimal screen
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Brzozowski &amp; Walton, 2001)</xref>
        and
to study crystal structures of the Kir potassium channel
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Clarke et al., 2010)</xref>
        . Such mixtures were incorporated into the
Pi-PEG screen.

    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>2.1. Pi sampling</title>
      <p>Pi sampling begins with up to 36 stock solutions, divided
into three sets of 12. The first set of solutions is used in the
screen at constant concentration. The second and third sets
are added according to a gradient between specified minimum
and maximum concentrations. Typically, the first set is
composed of buffers and the second and third sets are precipitants/
additives.</p>
      <p>The combinations of three stock solutions (one from each
set) are generated according to Fig. 1, where 1?12 refer to the
IDs for solutions of the first set, A?M to those of the second
set and N?X to those of the third set. The number in each cell
shows which solution of the first set will be combined with the
corresponding solutions of the second and third sets. Blank
spaces show when no such combinations are generated.</p>
      <p>Fig. 2 summarizes the distribution of the stock solutions in a
standard 96-condition plate layout (i.e. 12 columns and eight
rows).</p>
      <p>Set 1: each solution (ID 1?12) is seen in the eight conditions
forming a column of the plate. A variable should be
associated with the stock solutions. The variable corresponds to
a property of the solution selected (e.g. pH, molecular weight
of the main chemical, absorption properties or others).
values increase from left to right in the screen layout.</p>
      <p>Set 2: each solution (ID A?L) is represented once in each
row. The final concentrations decrease gradually from the top
to the bottom of the screen layout, forming a gradient. The
distribution of solutions A?L is based on the sequence of
values established for set 1: the positions of the solutions shift
across five columns and down one row. Solutions A?L should
also be associated with a variable and hence a sequence is
formed for the distribution of the third set of solutions.</p>
      <p>Set 3: each solution (ID M?X) is also represented once in
each row. The final concentrations increase gradually from the
top to the bottom of the screen, forming another gradient. The
solutions M?X are distributed with the same modulo
arithmetic operation as previously, but with respect to the values
of solutions A?L. For example, solution M is mixed with
solution A in the first row, solution F in the second row,
solution K in the third row and so on, as shown in Fig. 2. This
means that both the second and third sets are arranged
according to the same modulo arithmetic operation (5 modulo
12); however, when looking at the plate layout, the positions
of solutions M?X shift across ten columns and down one row.
2.2. Pi Sampler</p>
      <p>
        Pi Sampler can be accessed via the internet at http://
pisampler.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/. Users can enter the details
of up to 36 stock solutions, including stock concentrations,
desired screen concentration ranges and values. The
application then generates a 96-condition screen formulation
following the Pi sampling method described above.
Formulations, recipes and total required volumes of stock solutions are
presented and may conveniently be downloaded in
commaseparated variable format (CSV), allowing the user to import
them into other software for automated screen making

      <title>2.3. Pi minimal screen preparation and crystallization assays with commercially available soluble proteins</title>
      <p>The final formulation of the Pi minimal screen can be found
in Table 1. There are 36 starting stock solutions overall. Each
solution composing the first set (ID 1?12) is a mixture of an
acid with its corresponding base (e.g. HEPES pH 7.5: 1 M
HEPES solution mixed with 1 M HEPES sodium salt in order
to reach pH 7.5), except for buffer 11 (AMPD mixed with Tris
base). Note that this is also true for the precipitant phosphate
(phosphate system: sodium dihydrogen phosphate/dipotassium
hydrogen phosphate). Values of pH (4.0?9.5) were chosen as
the variable for the first set, whilst arbitrary values were
chosen for additives of various natures composing the second
set (ID A?L). Eventually, a few conditions were made without
additive/buffer because of chemical incompatibilities (Table 1).</p>
      <p>
        Highest purity grade chemicals (Molecular Biology grade
when available) were purchased from Sigma?Aldrich to
prepare 36 stock solutions. The solutions were mixed in 96
Falcon tubes. The screen was dispensed into ?MRC original
plates?
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">(96-well, two-drop, Swissci; Stock et al., 2005)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>Commercial proteins that had been crystallized before were
chosen to prepare test samples. Protein concentrations were
chosen randomly between 7 and 150 mg ml 1 (Table 2).
Vapour-diffusion experiments were set up at 295 K, mixing
two different sample: condition ratios (1:3 and 3:1) to give a
final volume of 400 nl. The plates were then stored at 291 K. A
condition was considered to be a hit when at least one of the
two corresponding drops contained crystals with well known
morphology after one week. Table 3 shows the ?hits per
condition? observed and the corresponding results expected for
the binomial distribution (see x4.2).</p>

      <title>2.4. Pi-PEG screen preparation and crystallization assays with a GPCR</title>
      <p>The final formulation of the Pi-PEG screen can be found in
Table 4. The formulation can also be generated using Pi
Sampler by loading the Pi-PEG example data. The pH values
(4.8?8.8) were chosen as the variable for the buffers
composing set 1 (ID 1?12), whilst molecular weight was
chosen for set 2 (PEGs A?L, final concentration range 0?
22.5%). The same 12 PEGs were used for set 3 (PEGs M?X,
final concentration range 0?45%). General details of the
preparation are similar to x2.3, but there are 24 stock solutions
at the start (instead of 36). Vapour-diffusion experiments were
set up at 277 K, mixing sample and condition in a 1:1 ratio to
give a final volume of 200 nl. The preparation of A2AR-GL31
will be published elsewhere (Lebon et al., submitted work).
Crystal X-ray screening was performed at the Diamond
Conc.</p>

employed for the Pi sampling, it may help to imagine, on a 12 h
clock, a series of events occurring every 5 h. The first event is
at noon, the second at 5 pm, then 10 pm, then 3 am etc.
Eventually, there is a succession of 12 events occurring at
different hours, with as much time as possible in between each
event. If we now look at combinations of three components,
there are originally 123 or 1728 possibilities. Pi Sampler
generates 96 of these combinations that correspond to
conditions that are distant in properties. The variety between
samples, we compared the results obtained with what would be
expected if each condition had the same probability of hits
overall (Table 3). This can be approximated by a binomial
distribution. The probability of success for the binomial
distribution is the observed probability for ten attempts: 116/
(10</p>
      <p>
        96) = 0.12083. The 2 statistic for the data is 3.48. This
can be compared with the quantiles of a 2 distribution with
two degrees of freedom, which gives a p value of 0.18
(calculations not shown). This
2 test indicates that no
conditions are obvious outliers with regard to success or
failure. There are, however, a multitude of possible biases
implied when proceeding with crystallization experiments
(which would be even more accentuated with the use of novel
samples); hence, any statistical analysis should be taken
with precaution. Nonetheless, it is interesting to see that the
analysis of the distribution is in accordance with the original
approach based on balanced randomization

        In addition, the conditions of the Pi minimal screen show
no identities to the extensive list of conditions (7230) from

      <title>5. Conclusions</title>
      <p>We have demonstrated that the Pi sampling is a methodical
and flexible approach to initial screening for macromolecular
crystallization. Two unique screens produced de novo have
resulted from this strategy. The Pi minimal screen potentially
has an ideal formulation for crystallization of novel soluble
protein samples. The Pi-PEG screen is a tailor-made screen for
GPCRs and potentially other membrane proteins generated
by biasing the formulation towards components known to be
essential.</p>
      <p>
        Further screens can be formulated with the Pi Sampler on a
day-to-day basis in order to test chemicals and techniques,
with the aim of increasing the yield of quality crystals. Also,
new crystallization techniques are constantly emerging for
macromolecular targets such as membrane proteins and hence
formulations with special considerations are required: one
may want to formulate screens compatible with the lipidic
cubic phase (LCP) concept
