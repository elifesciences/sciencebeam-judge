      <p>In 2001, we saw a 54-year-old woman with destructive
seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Because of secondary
osteoarthritis, she had received a replacement of the right hip
and of both knees, and a triple arthrodesis of the right foot.
Furthermore, she had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) and bronchiectasia.</p>
      <p>She complained of severe pain and a sensation of heavy
pressure at the site of the manubrio-sternal joint (MSJ), which had
developed at the beginning of 2000, making coughing very
difficult. She had a tender swelling at the same location on the
sternum and we saw a dorsal dislocation of the manubrium. A
severe thoracic kyphosis was also observed. A radiograph and
CT showed a luxation of the MSJ (Figure). The patient also
required a hemiarthroplasty of the left shoulder, so we planned
to perform an arthrodesis of the MSJ in the same session.</p>
      <p>Hemiarthroplasty of the left shoulder was first performed
and then the arthrodesis of the sternum was started. However,
during this procedure, on trying to place the manubrium back
into position, we observed that there would still be a bone gap
of about 1 cm and too much tension on the manubrium. We
decided, therefore, to do a resection arthroplasty.
Approximately 1 cm of the manubrium and 1 cm of the sternum was
resected and the gap was closed by the soft tissue layers,
which had been displaced. The skin was closed and a deep
drain was left in.</p>
      <p>
        During the first 2 years after surgery, she had no pain or
sensation of pressure on the sternum, and the swelling had
almost disappeared. She could sit in a more relaxed position,
which made coughing easier. Later on, the swelling slowly
progressed but the patient still did not experience any pain. At
7 years, physical examination revealed an eminent swelling of
the sternum but without any tenderness. The patient was very
satisfied with the result. Radiography showed that the sternum
was positioned 4 cm anteriorly to the manubrium.
Discussion
In 1950, Bogdan and Clark first described 5 cases of painful
rheumatoid involvement of the MSJ. In 2 cases, the symptoms
disappeared spontaneously after just 1 month. In 1 case, the
pain was relieved by aspirin and in the other 2 cases no
treatment was mentioned. In 1979,
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">Rapoport et al. (1979)</xref>
        described
an RA patient with a painful anterior subluxation of the sternal
body on the manubrium. No treatment was discussed,
however. In 1981, Wiseman described a patient with rheumatoid
arthritis with posterior dislocation of the manubrium on the
sternum, and pointed out that complaints in this area could be
the result of a dislocation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">Khong and Rooney (1982)</xref>
        reviewed approximately 400
patients with classical RA. 10 of them had a subluxation of
the MSJ, all of whom had substantial swelling over the MSJ
with crepitus and deformity. Erosions and subluxation were
found on lateral radiographs of the sternum in all 10 cases. The
authors referred to
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">Laitinen et al. (1970)</xref>
        and
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">Kormano (1970)</xref>
        who had also reported that the MSJ is often involved in RA,
but seldom leads to signicfiant clinical problems. They did not
mention the exact symptoms of the patients with subluxation of
the MSJ, and nothing was written about the patients? desire for
treatment of their symptoms, if this should be available.

        , and
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">Kelly et al. (1986)</xref>
        described
12 RA patients in total with thoracic kyphosis and MSJ
dislocation. In the patients they described, 11 had severe kyphosis?
as in our patient.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">Kelly et al. (1986)</xref>
        described the anatomical
development of MSJ as the reason that it can be involved in
RA, and described the role of kyphosis in transmitting force via
the rfist rib to the manubrium, which can lead to dislocation.
      </p>
      <p>We have not found any reports on the treatment of
symptomatic MSJ luxation.</p>
