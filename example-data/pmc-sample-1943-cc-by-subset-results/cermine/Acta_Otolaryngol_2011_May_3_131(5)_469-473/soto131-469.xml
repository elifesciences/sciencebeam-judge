        <p>Conclusion: The saccular duct and endolymphatic sinus run in the bony groove, before reaching the orifice of the vestibular aqueduct. We first clinically visualized this sulciform groove using three-dimensional (3D) cone beam CT images. This strategy can be useful to assess the condition of the saccular duct and endolymphatic sinus concerning the longitudinal flow system of endolymph. Objective: To assess the saccular duct and endolymphatic sinus in the endolymphatic system in order to advance clinical studies on inner ear dysfunction. Methods: The sulciform groove of the saccular duct and endolymphatic sinus of human subjects was analyzed by cone beam CT and compared with that of a cadaver. Results: We could obtain reconstructed 3D CT images of the sulciform groove of the saccular duct and endolymphatic sinus using several CT window levels.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
        The saccule connects with two ducts, the reuniting
and saccular ducts, which are respectively the paths of
endolymph. These paths are important in the
longitudinal flow theory [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ], whereby the endolymph goes
directly from the cochlea to the endolymphatic sac.
This theory explains the cause of Meniere?s disease,
which exhibits endolymphatic hydrops [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2 ref3">2,3</xref>
        ]. From
this viewpoint, the vestibular aqueduct that follows
the saccular duct was initially clinically visualized and
used as a diagnostic tool for Meniere?s disease [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4 ref5">4,5</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        We also clinically analyzed the reuniting duct by
visualizing it with three-dimensional computed
tomography (3D CT) to diagnose Meniere?s disease
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6 ref7 ref8">6?8</xref>
        ]. However, the saccular duct has not been
clinically visualized. The reason is that the saccular duct is
membranous, facing endolymph inside and
perilymph outside, and so CT and MRI have limitations
for visualizing it. The saccular duct becomes
endolymphatic sinus running in the bony sulciform groove
before ending in the vestibular aqueduct, which may
be visualized in 3D CT images as a bony substance,
like the bony groove of the reuniting duct (YT groove)
in a previous study [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6 ref7">6,7</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>In the present study, we investigated whether the
saccular duct and endolymphatic sinus could be
demonstrated on clinical images using cone beam
3D CT.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>Material and methods</title>
      <p>
        We investigated the saccular duct and endolymphatic
sinus and their sulciform groove in the temporal
bones of bilaterally healthy ears of 12 controls (6 males
and 6 females; mean age 58.4 years, range 35?79
years), which had been included in a previous study
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ] employing cone beam CT (3D Accuitomo; J.
Morita Mfg Corp., Kyoto, Japan) and the temporal
bone of a cadaver donated to our medical university of
anatomy, with the consent of the deceased and our
university, to compare the findings in human subjects
with those in the cadaver.
      </p>
      <p>CT images were investigated using cone beam
CT to obtain images under the following
conditions: 80 kV, 6 mA, voxel 0.125 0.125
0.125 mm, slice thickness 0.5 mm. CT images of
this region were taken as a column with a diameter
and height of 6 cm. Reconstructed 3D images of the
inner ear were obtained using rendering software
(IVIEW; J. Morita Mfg Corp.) using a perspective
view with a viewing angle of 15 and a 0.25 mm
voxel (0.25 0.25 0.25 mm).</p>
      <p>
        To obtain 3D CT images of the saccular duct and
endolymphatic sinus in accordance with cadaver
specimens, we adopted the landmarks reported in
a previous study to reduce discrepancies due to
rendering effect [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        ]. 3D CT images are manipulated
so that the saccule, YT groove, and vestibular
portion of the posterior semicircular canal and ridge of
the cochlea just sloping down to the vestibule in
front are all viewed in one frame. With this view, the
bony sulciform groove of the saccular duct and
endolymphatic sinus is visible. Then, this image
can be manipulated through pitch or yaw to yield
a view from directly above the sulciform groove to
decrease the artifact by rendering effects. Also,
several CT window levels were used in one view
to visualize the groove from the surrounding

      <p>Cochlea</p>
      <p>IAC
A sulciform groove from the saccular fossa to the
orifice of the vestibular aqueduct in which the saccular
duct and endolymphatic sinus run could be localized
in the cadaver specimen (Figure 1A?D). The
sulciform groove of the endolymphatic sinus was distinct
but that of the saccular duct was unclear (Figures 1C
and 2A). Employing a direction in which the
saccule and saccular duct and endolymphatic sinus
can be seen from directly above, the groove-like 3D
CT image of the saccular duct and endolymphatic
sinus were consistent with macroscopic findings
(Figure 2A?C). This groove-like image was made
up of two colors when CT was imaged with these
bone and soft tissue CT window levels (Figure 2C).
Further, this image was consistent with macroscopic
cadaveric findings because there was a torn
membranous labyrinth around the groove that could be
imaged as soft tissue by CT.</p>
      <p>Groove-like 3D CT images of the saccular duct
and endolymphatic sinus were obtained in all
12 human subjects. The aspects of the groove were
similar among the 12 healthy subjects (Figures 3
and 4).</p>
      <p>The images of the groove reconstructed using
several CT window levels such as a high or low
density of bone revealed more accurate images
(Figure 3B and C), especially the lumen of the</p>

groove, which was more manifested
three-dimensionally compared with single CT window levels
(Figure 3A?C).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>
        The vestibular aqueduct has been assessed in
relation to the etiology of Meniere?s disease, where
the endolymphatic duct runs and reaches the
endolymphatic sac. This clinical strategy is based on the
fact that idiopathic endolymphatic hydrops, a
pathological entity of Meniere?s disease, is caused by the
blockage of endolymph in the endolymphatic duct or
sac [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref9">9,10</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>However, there are few reports on the saccular duct
and endolymphatic sinus despite these sites and the
vestibular aqueduct being directly connected.</p>
      <p>
        Most saccular duct and endolymphatic sinus
studies are limited to animal experiments or specimens of
human temporal bone [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref3">3,10</xref>
        ], because the saccular
duct and endolymphatic sinus are too small and
membranous to assess clinically. The saccular duct
and endolymphatic sinus are not a bony groove
themselves but run in the bony groove, which could be
visualized clinically using 3D CT. When the saccular
duct or endolymphatic sinus is involved as a lesion in
inner ear disease, their bony grooves may reflect the
lesional effect. A similar strategy was adopted to assess
      </p>
      <p>IAC
duct directly connects with the saccule, we cannot
deny the possibility that dislodged otoconia from
the saccule may enter the saccular duct or
endolymphatic sinus in a similar manner to that in the
reuniting duct.</p>
      <p>Investigating the saccular duct and endolymphatic
sinus will provide novel information regarding inner
ear diseases caused by longitudinal flow disturbances
of endolymph, especially Meniere?s disease. We will
also further investigate the role of these architectures.</p>
