        <p>Background: Hypophosphatemia occurs in up to 80% of the patients during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Phosphate supplementation is time-consuming and the phosphate level might be dangerously low before normophosphatemia is re-established. This study evaluated the possibility to prevent hypophosphatemia during CRRT treatment by using a new commercially available phosphate-containing dialysis fluid. Methods: Forty-two heterogeneous intensive care unit patients, admitted between January 2007 and July 2008, undergoing hemodiafiltration, were treated with a new Gambro dialysis solution with 1.2 mM phosphate (Phoxilium) or with standard medical treatment (Hemosol B0). The patients were divided into three groups: group 1 (n 5 14) receiving standard medical treatment and intravenous phosphate supplementation as required, group 2 (n 5 14) receiving the phosphate solution as dialysate solution and Hemosol B0 as replacement solution and group 3 (n 5 14) receiving the phosphate-containing solution as both dialysate and replacement solutions.</p>

      <p>HE majority of patients on continuous renal
phate supplementation shortly after CRRT
initiation.1 One reason is that critically ill patients
present several conditions predisposing
hypophosphatemia such as sepsis, alcohol withdrawal,
malnutrition, catecholamines, intravenous glucose
infusion, hyperventilation, diuretics and
rhabdomyolysis.2?4 Another reason is the CRRT technique
that achieves high clearance of small solutes, such
as phosphate.5?9 In addition, low serum phosphate
levels may also occur in the setting of extracellular
to intracellular shifts that occur with respiratory
alkalosis, high blood concentrations of stress
horResults: Standard medical treatment resulted in
hypophosphatemia in 11 of 14 of the patients (group 1) compared
with five of 14 in the patients receiving phosphate solution
as the dialysate solution and Hemosol B0 as the
replacement solution (group 2). Patients treated with the
phosphate-containing dialysis solution (group 3) experienced
stable serum phosphate levels throughout the study.
Potassium, ionized calcium, magnesium, pH, pCO2 and
bicarbonate remained unchanged throughout the study.
Conclusion: The new phosphate-containing replacement
and dialysis solution reduces the variability of serum
phosphate levels during CRRT and eliminates the
incidence of hypophosphatemia.

and with refeeding syndrome.</p>
      <p>As phosphate is a constituent of enzymes and
intermediate phosphorylated compounds, it plays
a key role in cellular metabolism and is essential in
several biological processes. Serum phosphate
concentration is maintained between 0.81 and
1.45 mmol/l. By convention, hypophosphatemia is
often graded as mild (o0.81 mmol/l), moderate
(o0.61 mmol/l) and severe (o0.32 mmol/l). Severe
hypophosphatemia has been linked to increased
mortality in surgical intensive care patients7 and
was recently shown to serve as an independent
mortality predictor in sepsis.10 Symptoms of
hypophosphatemia are usually only seen in patients
with moderate or severe hypophosphatemia and
include ventilatory muscle weakness, cardiac
failure, insulin resistance, hemolysis, impaired
platelet and white blood cell function,
rhabdomyolysis, and, in rare cases, neurologic disorders.3,11?17
However, all these alternations have been shown
to reverse by simply correcting the phosphate
levels.3,7,12,13,18?20 Phosphate is supplemented
intravenously in symptomatic patients, but
phosphate has also been added directly to the
dialysate and replacement fluids,1,21,22 with a risk
of precipitation with calcium.</p>
      <p>The development of many electrolyte
disturbances in the intensive care unit (ICU) could be
prevented by the use of better adapted dialysis
fluids. This study evaluated the possibility to achieve
and maintain a normal phosphate balance over time
in patients on CRRT by using a new
phosphatecontaining dialysis fluid and replacement fluid.</p>

Sweden, Table 1). As a control, we used our routine
dialysis solution that does not contain phosphate
(Hemosol B0, Gambro Lundia AB, Table 1). At our
ICU at Lund University Hospital we applied three
regimes, half a year each, for all patients requiring
CRRT treatment. The treatment mode used was
CVVHDF. During the first period (group 1), all the
patients received dialysate solution and replacement
solution that did not contain phosphate (Hemosol
B0), during the next half year (group 2), all patients
requiring CRRT treatment received the
phosphatecontaining solution as dialysis solution and a
phosphate-free replacement solution (Hemosol B0) and
finally during the last half year period (group 3), the
patients received the phosphate-containing solution
both as a dialysis solution and as a replacement
solution. Blood sampling was performed according
to normal routines at our department, but the
physicians in charge continuously modified the CRRT
treatment settings and the phosphate
supplementation according to the patients? ongoing clinical needs.
The physicians treating the patients did not have
knowledge of the study setting during the
treatments, but they were fully aware of the fluids and

      <p>The serum phosphate level was 1.90 mmol/l at
baseline and 0.99 mmol/l during CRRT treatment in
group 1. In group 2, the corresponding values were
1.54 and 1.20 mmol/l, and in group 3, they were 1.83
and 1.43 mmol/l (Table 5). However, due to the
simultaneous intake of enteral/parenteral solutions,
two of 14 of the patients in group 3 had a temporary
increase in serum phosphate (o1.9 mmol/l), but
there were no cases of hyperphosphatemia that
required a withdrawal of the phosphate-containing
dialysis solution from the treatment.</p>
      <p>Phosphate intake was from nutrition and from
intravenous supplementation. The average
phosphate input calculated from the total nutrition was
18 mmol/CRRT treatment/day for all groups.
Short-acting insulin was administered as infusion
in order to achieve a blood glucose level between 5
and 8 mmol/l. Phosphate was supplemented
intravenously if serum phosphate declined to
o0.80 mmol/l. In group 1, the average phosphate
supplementation was 10 mmol/CRRT treatment/
day. In group 2, the average supplementation was
5 mmol/CRRT treatment and day, and in group 3,
there was no intravenous supplementation.</p>

remained stable during the entire study as
summarized in Table 4. A comparison between the study

difference in phosphate (P 0.001), ionized calcium
(P 5 0.004) and bicarbonate (P 5 0.045) between the

      <p>CRRT and reduces the incidence of
hypophosphatemia.</p>
      <p>Various protocols for intravenous phosphate
supplementation have been studied in the last 30
years. Today, there is a trend toward the use of
larger and faster boluses of phosphate because of
high failure of repletion (20?70%) and the need for
additional phosphate administration.24?31 Authors
usually agree that larger amounts of phosphate are
needed to correct total body deficit, but their fear of
adverse reactions has prompted a restrained
attitude. Recent studies on ICU patients confirm that a
relatively rapid infusion of potassium phosphate is
safe if baseline serum potassium is below
4.5 mmol/l.1 The infusion rate is thus consequently
limited by the serum potassium levels, and also by
serum calcium levels, as high phosphate serum
levels could induce hypocalcemia, as phosphate
could precipitate with calcium in blood vessels and
tissues. Recently, phosphate has been injected into
dialysis solutions during treatment, but there is a
risk of precipitation.1,21,22 We evaluated whether
phosphate-containing solutions for dialysis and
replacement simplify phosphate replacement even
further.</p>
      <p>Serum solute concentrations (mmol/l) during CRRT with the phosphate containing dialysis fluid for patients in group 3.</p>
      <p>Before</p>
      <p>The frequency of phosphate disturbances in
critically ill patients is high, although the figure
varies considerably depending on the study,
between 8.8% and 80%.32,33 In our study, the
incidence of hypophosphatemia during CRRT was 79%
in the control group. The incidence of
hypophosphatemia was lower (35%) in patients receiving
the phosphate-containing solution as the dialysis
solution and Hemosol B0 as the replacement
solution. There were no episodes of hypophosphatemia
in patients receiving only the phosphate-containing
solution, but there was an incidence of mild
(&gt;1.9 mmol/l) hyperphosphatemia in 14% of these
patients. This is probably due to the simultaneous
intake of nutritional support, but the phosphate
levels were only marginally elevated without
physiological consequences and did not require
withdrawal of the phosphate-containing dialysis
solution from the patient.</p>
      <p>The amount of phosphate required to correct
total body deficit is variable and depends on the
cause of hypophosphatemia and the chronicity of
the process.3,11,24 The many physiological
rearrangements in ICU patients may explain the need for
larger amounts required for repletion. In our study,
phosphate addition was necessary for patients in
groups 1 and 2. This is representative of our
experience, where the majority of patients on
CRRT require phosphate supplementation shortly
after CRRT initiation despite nutritional support.</p>
      <p>Malnourished alcoholic patients have a larger
deficit due to long-standing negative phosphate
balance. Malnutrition induces a re-feeding syndrome
that has been reported after only 48 h of fasting in
the ICU.2 The distribution volume for phosphate
might be increased,24 while insulin, carbohydrate,
and catecholamine administration act to decrease
the serum phosphate concentration.2,3,11,34</p>
      <p>The incidence of hypophosphatemia in this
study was 10% of the 42 patients before the start
of CRRT. The incidence of hyperphosphatemia was
52%, which is slightly lower than that found in
other studies, where 65?80% of patients present
hyperphosphatemia before the start of the
CRRT.8,35 Phosphate was within normal limits in
38% of patients even before the beginning of
CRRT. The new dialysis fluid contains 30 mM
bicarbonate compared with 32 mM in Hemosol
B0. With prescribed CRRT clearances of 20 ml/
kg/h, most acid?base disturbances can be
managed with bicarbonate compositions of 25?
35 mM.36 The normal serum range for bicarbonate
is 22?30 mmol/l, which was achieved in patients
in all groups, although the increase in group 1
was most significant. Ionized calcium increased in
all groups during treatment time, but the increase
was less marked in groups 2 and 3. There is a
possibility that the slow increase in bicarbonate
and ionized calcium could reflect the differences
in the ion content between Hemosol B0 and the
phosphate-containing dialysis fluid, although
these differences could also be due to the
limitations of this study. The fact that this was a
retrospective observational study, without other
intervention but for the dialysis solutions, means
that bias due to the patients? illnesses and due to
other treatments could affect ion concentrations.</p>
      <p>Even the phosphate concentration in parenteral
and enteral nutrition cannot be completely
excluded, although this would not alter the basic
results of the study.</p>
      <p>The next objective of the study was to evaluate
whether the administered phosphate could alter
calcium and potassium homeostasis. Phosphate
could theoretically precipitate with calcium, which
could lead to hypocalcemia in the patients. We
found that the phosphate-containing dialysis fluid
did not induce hypocalcemia during CRRT.
Another important concern was whether this fluid
would cause potassium overload, as potassium
phosphate is used instead of sodium phosphate.</p>
      <p>We found that the phosphate-containing dialysis
fluid did not induce hyperkalemia either.
Potassium phosphate was favored over sodium
phosphate because potassium usually has to be added
to CRRT solutions. In addition, there were no
disturbances of magnesium levels.</p>
      <p>The present study shows that by using the
phosphate-containing fluid both as the dialysis fluid and
the replacement fluid, we could eliminate the
episodes of hypophosphatemia. The new
phosphatecontaining dialysis fluid simplified the phosphate
control and avoided rapid phosphate fluctuations
with intravenous bolus administration.</p>
