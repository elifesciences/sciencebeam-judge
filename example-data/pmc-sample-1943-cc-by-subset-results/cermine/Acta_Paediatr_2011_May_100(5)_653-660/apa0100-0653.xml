        <p>Aim: To determine whether the size and shape of the placental surface predict blood pressure in childhood. Methods: We studied blood pressure in 471 nine-year-old Indian children whose placental length, breadth and weight were measured in a prospective birth cohort study. Results: In the daughters of short mothers (&lt;median height), systolic blood pressure (SBP) rose as placental breadth increased (b = 0.69 mmHg ? cm, p = 0.05) and as the ratio of placental surface area to birthweight increased (p = 0.0003). In the daughters of tall mothers, SBP rose as the difference between placental length and breadth increased (b = 1.40 mmHg ? cm, p = 0.007), that is as the surface became more oval. Among boys, associations with placental size were only statistically significant after adjusting for current BMI and height. After adjustment, SBP rose as placental breadth, area and weight decreased (for breadth b = )0.68 mmHg ? cm, p &lt; 0.05 for all three measurements).</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>
        People whose birthweights were towards the lower end of
the normal range have higher blood pressures and are at
increased risk of developing hypertension in later life (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref2 ref3">1?3</xref>
        ).
This is thought to reflect foetal programming, the process by
which malnutrition and other adverse influences during
development alter gene expression and programme the
body?s structures and function for life (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4 ref5">4,5</xref>
        ). These adverse
influences may also slow foetal growth, leading to low
birthweight (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ). A baby?s birthweight reflects its success in
obtaining nutrients from its mother. The source of these
nutrients is not only the mother?s current diet but her
metabolism, which is a product of her lifetime?s nutrition
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        ). Height is one indicator of a woman?s nutrition in early
life (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ), and women who are short have lower rates of
protein synthesis during pregnancy than do women who are tall
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
        ).
      </p>
      <p>
        A baby?s birthweight also depends on the placenta?s
ability to transport nutrients to it from its mother (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ). Small
babies generally have small placentas (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ), which suggests
that placental size is an indicator of placental function. In
some circumstances, however, an undernourished baby can
expand its placental surface to extract more nutrients from
the mother (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        ). This leads to high placental weight in
relation to birthweight. Both low placental weight and high
placental weight in relation to birthweight have been shown
to predict later hypertension (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12 ref13 ref14">12?14</xref>
        ). Placental weight has
inconsistent associations with blood pressure levels in
children. There are reported associations between increased
levels of blood pressure and low placental weight and a high
ratio of placental weight to birthweight (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref16">15,16</xref>
        ). Other
studies have found no associations (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
        ). While the size of the
placenta is linked to foetal nutrition, which nutrients are
delivered to the foetus is conditional on their availability in
the maternal circulation. This will be related to the mother?s
body size. The effects of placental size on later hypertension
are conditioned by the mother?s body size (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        ) because her
body is the source of nutrients.
      </p>
      <p>The weight of the placenta does not distinguish its
thickness from its surface area. To increase the surface for
nutrient and oxygen exchange, the placenta can expand its
invasion across the surface of the uterine lining or invade
the maternal spiral arteries more deeply. The long-term
consequences of these may be different.</p>
      <p>
        The surface of the placenta is generally described as oval
or round. To measure the ovality, two so-called diameters of
the surface were routinely recorded in some hospitals (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        ).
The maximal diameter described the length of the surface,
while the lesser one bisecting it at right angles described the
breadth. Studies in Finland and Holland have shown that
hypertension in the offspring in later life is related to the
size of the placental surface (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        ). This relation depends
more on the breadth of the surface than on its length.
      </p>
      <p>
        We measured the length and breadth of the placental
surface in a study of newborn babies in Mysore, South India
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
        ). The children?s blood pressures were measured at the
age of 9 years. We hypothesized that blood pressure levels
would be related to the size of the placental surface and
would relate more to the breadth than the length. We also
hypothesized that the associations would depend on the
mother?s height. The relation between placental size and
later hypertension differs in the two sexes (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
        ). We
therefore examined boys and girls separately.
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>METHODS</title>
      <p>
        In 1997, the Mysore Parthenon study recruited pregnant
women attending the antenatal clinic at the Holdsworth
Memorial Hospital (HMH) in Mysore, South India (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18 ref20">18,20</xref>
        ).
The hospital ethical committee approved the study, and
informed written consent was obtained from the parents
and children. All women who had a singleton pregnancy
and who were not diabetic before pregnancy were eligible.
Out of 1233 eligible women, 830 (67%) took part in the
study. At 30 ± 2 weeks of gestation, their body size was
measured, including their height, using standardized
methods. One hundred and fifty-six women delivered elsewhere
and were not followed up any further: the remaining 674
women delivered live-born babies at HMH. Seven babies
were stillborn and four had major congenital abnormalities.
Neonatal anthropometric measurements were made on the
remaining 663 within 72 h of birth by one of the four
trained measurers, again using standardized methods.
Weight was measured using digital weighing scales (Seca,
Germany); crown-heel length was measured using a
Harpenden neonatal stadiometer (CMS instruments, London,
UK); head circumference was measured with blank
anthropometric tape, marked and measured against a fixed ruler.
      </p>
      <p>Placental dimensions were measured in 653 of the babies.
The placentae were initially checked for completeness, and
the cord clamp was released to allow the blood to drain.
The amnion was stripped off, and the chorion was trimmed
close to the placental edge. The cord was cut flush with the
placenta, and any obvious clots were removed. The placenta
was weighed using an electronic weighing machine. It was
then placed on a flat surface, with the cotyledons facing
upwards. The longest diameter (length) was identified by
eye and measured using a graduated transparent plastic
ruler placed on the surface. The diameter perpendicular to
the length was defined as the breadth and was measured in
the same way.</p>
      <sec id="sec-2-1">
        <title>Postnatal follow-up</title>
        <p>The children were followed up annually from birth until
5 years of age, and every six months thereafter. Eight
children were excluded because of major medical conditions,
while a further 25 children died. Ninety-one children did
not attend the nine and a half year follow-up (nine
untraceable, 26 moved away and 56 declined to participate)
so that 539 children were examined (Figure 1). Further
anthropometry was carried out including weight (Salter,
Tonbridge, Kent, UK), height (Microtoise; CMS
instruments) and mid-upper arm circumference. Systolic and
diastolic blood pressures were measured in the left arm using
an automated blood pressure monitor (Dinamap8100,
Criticon, FL, USA). Appropriate-sized cuffs were selected
for use based on the mid-upper arm circumference. Two
recordings were made after five minutes seated at rest, and
the average taken. The observers were unaware of the
neonatal measurements of the children. The techniques used by
different observers were standardized by regular intra- and
inter-observer variation studies.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-2">
        <title>Analysis sample</title>
        <p>Blood pressure was recorded for all 539 children who
attended the 9.5-year follow-up. Because placental size is
increased in gestational diabetes, we excluded from the
analysis 35 children whose mothers developed diabetes
during gestation and 25 children for whom maternal glucose
tolerance test data were missing. We included seven
children born to mothers who developed hypertension and 29
babies born preterm. Placental measurements were missing
for eight children, and hence our study sample comprises
the remaining 471 children with complete measurements of
the placenta.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-3">
        <title>Statistical methods</title>
        <p>
          The data included the weight of the placenta and the length
and breadth of its surface. Placental area was calculated
assuming an elliptical surface, using the maximal diameter
(length) · lesser diameter (breadth) · p ? 4 (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
          ). We
calculated the difference between the length and breadth of the
surface and the ratio of placental area to birthweight. We
examined associations between placental variables and
blood pressure using linear regression, unadjusted and then
adjusted for the child?s body mass index (BMI) and height
at 9.5 years; where p values from adjusted models are used,
this is stated. We used linear regression to examine
interactions between the effects on blood pressure of placental size
and maternal height. Among girls, there were interactions
between the effects of placental size and maternal height
(see Results); and, as in the analyses of the Helsinki Birth
Cohort (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref19">11,19</xref>
          ), we examined separate models for girls born
to mothers above and below the median height (154.5 cm).
There were no similar interactions between placental size
and maternal height in boys.

      <title>RESULTS</title>
      <p>
        Table 1 shows the mean measurements of the 471 mothers,
placentas, babies and children. None of the mothers
smoked tobacco. At birth, boys were larger than girls, but
their placental size was similar. Twelve boys and eight girls
had systolic hypertension, using standard criteria (

difference in maternal height between these two groups:
154.3 cm vs. 156.4 cm, p = 0.0002).</p>
      <p>Among boys, neither systolic nor diastolic pressure was
related to birthweight, head circumference, birth length or
the length of gestation. Table 2 shows the trends in blood
pressure with placental size. Systolic pressure tended to rise
as placental breadth, weight and area decreased. These trends
became statistically significant after adjusting for the child?s
current BMI and height (for breadth b = )0.68 mmHg ? cm).
The trends with breadth and weight also became statistically
significant after adjusting for birth weight (p = 0.04 for
breadth and p = 0.03 for weight). Systolic pressure tended to
rise as the ratio of placental area to birth weight decreased;
however, this trend was not statistically significant. Diastolic
pressure was unrelated to placental size.</p>
      <p>Among girls, systolic and diastolic pressure fell as
birthweight increased (systolic pressure fell by 4.2 mmHg per kg
increase in birthweight, 95% CI 1.4?6.9, p = 0.003;
diastolic pressure fell by 2.6 mmHg per kg increase, 95% CI
0.3?4.9, p = 0.03, after adjusting for current BMI). Systolic
pressure in girls also fell as birth length increased
(p = 0.04, adjusted for current BMI). It was not related to
head circumference or to the length of gestation. Table 2
shows the trends in blood pressure with placental size.
Systolic blood pressure rose as the ratio of area to birthweight
increased. Diastolic blood pressure fell as placental weight
increased. In Table 3, the trends in blood pressure with
placental size among girls are divided according to the
mother?s median height. Among girls whose mothers?
height was below the median, systolic pressure rose as
placental breadth increased (b = 0.69 mmHg ? cm) and as the
ratio of placental area to birthweight increased. In a
simultaneous regression, both larger placental area and lower
birthweight were associated with higher systolic pressure
(p = 0.001 and 0.002, respectively). Diastolic pressure also
rose as the ratio of placental area to birthweight increased;
however, this was a weaker trend than that for systolic
pressure.</p>
      <p>Among girls whose mothers? height was above the
median, there were no trends in systolic blood pressure with
either placental length, breadth or area (Table 3), but
systolic pressure rose as the difference between the diameters
increased (b = 1.40 mmHg ? cm, p = 0.007), that is as the
placental surface became more oval. In contrast to systolic
pressure, diastolic pressure rose as placental breadth, length
and area decreased, but was unrelated to the difference
between diameters. The differing trends in systolic pressure
with placental size in the two maternal height groups were

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>
        We found that the blood pressures of 9-year-old children in
south India were related to the size and shape of the
placental surface at birth. We suggest that these associations reflect
the role of placental function in programming blood
pressure (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>
        ). Consistent with findings in the Helsinki birth
Cohort, we found different associations in boys and girls
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
        ). Boys grow faster than girls from an early stage of
gestation, even from before implantation, and this makes them
more vulnerable if their nutrition is compromised (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23 ref8">8,23</xref>
        ).
More newborn boys than girls have retarded growth and
placental abnormalities, and most of them die during the
perinatal period (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>
        ). The associations between blood
pressure and placental size were modified by adjustment for the
child?s current body size. This reflects the known
association between raised blood pressure and rapid postnatal
growth (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ).
      </p>
      <p>
        We found that three different placental phenotypes
predicted raised blood pressure depending on the child?s sex
and the mother?s height. Common to each phenotype was
that blood pressure was related to the shape or size of the
placental surface and to the breadth rather than to the
length. Many studies have shown that raised blood pressure
in children and adults is related to lower birthweight within
the normal range (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref15 ref16 ref17 ref2 ref3">1?3,15?17</xref>
        ). This suggests that blood

pressure levels are linked to foetal malnutrition (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ). We now
examine each of the three placental phenotypes and discuss
their possible relation to foetal malnutrition.
      </p>
      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>Boys, small placental surface</title>
        <p>
          In boys, higher systolic blood pressure was associated with
smaller placental area. This association depended on
reduction in placental breadth rather than length. This is
consistent with findings among men in Holland, in whom
hypertension was related to a short placental breadth but
not to length (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
          ). One suggestion is that tissue along the
breadth is more closely related to nutrient delivery to the
foetus than tissue along the length of the surface, and
shorter breadth results in lesser delivery (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
          ). The length
and breadth of the placental surface are established by
growth of the chorionic surface in mid-gestation. We
suggest that reduced growth in placental breadth is associated
with foetal malnutrition and raised blood pressure in
boys.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among boys, the effects of placental size on blood
pressure were not conditioned by the mothers? height. In the
Helsinki Birth Cohort (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
          ), the effects of placental surface
area on hypertension were not related to the mother?s
height in men, but were stronger among women with short
mothers. This led to the suggestion that, compared to boys,
the nutrition of girls in utero depends more on the mothers?
lifetime nutrition and metabolism, reflected in her height
than on the mothers? diet in pregnancy (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
          ).
        </p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-2">
        <title>Girls, large placental surface</title>
        <p>
          In girls whose mother?s height was below the median, raised
systolic pressure was associated with a large placental area
in relation to birthweight. This association is therefore
opposite to that seen in the Helsinki cohort, in which
hypertension was associated with smaller placental area,
especially in women with shorter mothers (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
          ). Again, the
association in our study depended more on the breadth of
the placental surface than on its length. A study of men and
women born in a maternity hospital in Preston, UK, showed
that high placental weight in relation to birthweight was
associated with later hypertension in the offspring (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
          ).
Measurements of the placental surface were not available.
This observation has been replicated, and high placental
weight in relation to birthweight has also been shown to
predict coronary heart disease (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref27">14,27</xref>
          ). In response to
maternal undernutrition in mid-gestation, foetal lambs are
able to extend the area of the placenta by expanding the
individual cotyledons (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>
          ). This increases the area available
for nutrient and oxygen exchange and, if normal nutrition is
restored in late gestation, there is a larger lamb than there
would otherwise have been. This is profitable for the farmer,
and manipulation of placental size by changing the pasture
of pregnant ewes is standard practice in sheep farming.
There is evidence that a similar process occurs in humans
and involves broadening of the placental surface rather than
elongation (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref19">11,19</xref>
          ). Compensatory placental expansion may
be beneficial in some circumstances, but if the
compensation is inadequate, and the foetus continues to be
undernourished, the need to share its nutrients with an enlarged
placenta may become an added metabolic burden that has
long-term costs, which includes raised blood pressure.

        <title>Girls, oval placental surface</title>
        <p>
          In girls whose mothers? height was above the median
higher, systolic pressure was predicted by a larger difference
between the breadth and length of the placental surface that
is by a more oval-shaped surface. In contrast, diastolic
pressure was not predicted by the shape of the surface but by its
size, pressures rising with decreasing placental area. In
pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia, a disorder that
is initiated by impaired implantation, the placental surface
is oval (
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
          ). We therefore suggest that the association
between systolic pressure and an oval placenta reflects
disruption of the processes of implantation, which includes
spiral artery invasion and recruitment, with consequent
foetal malnutrition. The association between small placental
area and diastolic pressure may reflect reduced expansion
of the chorionic surface in mid-gestation. We can offer no
explanation as to why impaired implantation would affect
systolic pressure while reduced expansion of the chorionic
surface would affect diastolic pressure.

        <title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title>
        <p>In the Parthenon study, placental and newborn size and
childhood blood pressure were measured by trained
research staff according to standard protocols. None of
the mothers smoked, and only seven had
pregnancyinduced hypertension. The study has achieved high
follow-up rates in the children; 80% of the original live-born
babies of nondiabetic mothers and 84% of surviving
children were studied at 9 years. The study is based on births
in one hospital in Mysore, and the participants may
therefore be unrepresentative of the whole Mysore population.
At the time of the study, the Holdsworth Memorial
Hospital was one of three large maternity units in Mysore. It
is situated in a relatively poor area of the city, and most
of the patients come from ?lower middle-class and
middle-class? families. However, it is not a specialist referral
hospital, and most women choose to deliver there
because of its proximity to home. We do not think loss to
follow-up would have introduced significant bias.
Although the mothers of the children included in our
study sample were significantly shorter than those lost to
follow-up, differences in birthweight and placental
measurements between these groups were small.</p>

      <title>CONCLUSION</title>
      <p>We suggest that variations in three normal processes of
placentation lead to foetal undernutrition and consequent
raised blood pressure. The processes are those that
accompany implantation and expansion of the chorionic surface
in mid-gestation and compensatory expansion of the
chorionic surface in late gestation. In girls, the effects of these
disruptions on blood pressure are conditioned by the mother?s
early nutrition as indicated by her height.</p>
