      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>
        Cell adhesion molecules are the primary mediators for various types
of cell?cell junctions and play essential roles in various cellular
processes, including morphogenesis, differentiation, proliferation and
migration
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4 ref7">(Harris &amp; Tepass, 2010; Ogita &amp; Takai, 2006)</xref>
        . In polarized
epithelial cells, cell?cell junctions comprise several adhesive
apparatuses including tight junctions (TJs), adherens junctions (AJs),
desmosomes and gap junctions. AJs regulate TJ formation and the
establishment of the apical?basal polarity at cell?cell adhesion sites
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref12">(Takai, Ikeda et al., 2008)</xref>
        . Nectins, which are immunoglobulin-like
cell adhesion molecules, and cadherins, which are Ca2+-dependent
cell adhesion molecules, localize at AJs and have essential
cooperative roles in AJ formation. Nectins initiate AJ formation before
cadherins form cell?cell adhesions. Initial cell?cell contacts are
formed between two neighbouring cells by nectins, and cadherins are
then recruited to the nectin-based adhesion sites to form strong cell?
cell adhesions. TJs are formed at the apical side of AJs. Together,
nectins and cadherins mediate TJ formation by recruiting junctional
adhesion molecules (JAMs), followed by claudins and occludins, to
the apical side of AJs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nectins comprise a family of four members, nectin-1, nectin-2,
nectin-3 and nectin-4, each with multiple isoforms
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref6">(Takai et al., 2003;
Ogita et al., 2010)</xref>
        . Most nectin-family members are membrane
glycoproteins with an extracellular N-terminal variable region-like
domain, two extracellular constant region-like domains, a
transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail. All nectins, except for
nectin-1 , nectin-1 , nectin-3 and nectin-4, contain a PDZ-binding
motif (E/A-X-Y-V) in their cytoplasmic tail. Through this sequence
the nectins can bind afadin, which itself binds to an actin filament and
-catenin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two nectin molecules on the surface of the same cell first form
cis-dimers, which is followed by the formation of trans-dimers of the
cis-dimers on apposing cells, resulting in the formation of cell?cell
adhesions
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref12">(Takai, Miyoshi et al., 2008)</xref>
        . Heterophilic
trans-interactions have been detected between nectin-1 and nectin-3, between
nectin-2 and nectin-3 and between nectin-1 and nectin-4. In addition
to their cell adhesion activity, nectin-1 and nectin-2, but not nectin-3
or nectin-4, serve as entry receptors for -herpesviruses by binding
the virus-envelope glycoprotein gD with different specificities
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref13 ref13 ref3 ref5 ref9">(Cocchi et al., 1998; Sakisaka et al., 2001; Lopez et al., 2000; Geraghty
et al., 1998; Warner et al., 1998)</xref>
        . While nectin-1 shows activity as a
receptor for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), HSV-2,
pseudorabies virus (PRV) and bovine herpesvirus type 1, nectin-2 mediates
the entry of HSV-2 and PRV.
      </p>
      <p>To further understand how nectin-family members form
cisinteractions and trans-interactions, structural information on the
extracellular region of nectin-family members is fundamental. Here,
we report the refolding, crystallization and preliminary X-ray
crystallographic analyses of the extracellular regions of nectin-1 and
nectin-2. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the
crystallization of the whole extracellular regions of nectins.</p>

      <title>2. Materials and methods</title>
      <p>2.1. Protein expression and purification of inclusion bodies</p>
      <p>Genes encoding the extracellular region of human nectin-1
(nectin-1-EC; residues 30?335) or mouse nectin-2 (nectin-2-EC;
residues 32?339) were PCR-amplified using the Expand High Fidelity
PCR system (Roche) from respective full-length cDNAs using
primer A (50-TAGGATCCGTCCCAGGCGTCCACTCC-30;
nectin1 , forward) and primer B
(50-TAGCGGCCGCTTCTGTGATATTGACCTCCACC-30; nectin-1 , reverse) or primer C
(50-TAGGATCCGCAGGATGTGCGAGTTCAAGTGC-30; nectin-2 , forward)
and primer D
(50-TAGCGGCCGCGTCTCGCACCAGGATGACCT-30; nectin-2 , reverse). The PCR products were inserted into the
pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), which contains 30-T overhangs at
the insertion site. Target genes were isolated by digestion of the
plasmids with the restriction enzymes BamHI and NotI and were
confirmed by DNA sequencing. This was followed by ligation into the
T7 promoter expression vector pET21b (Novagen) in frame with a
C-terminal 6 His tag. Each recombinant plasmid was transformed
into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen).</p>
      <p>The cells were cultured in Luria?Bertani broth containing
100 mg ml 1 ampicillin at 310 K until the OD600 reached 0.5?0.7.
Protein expression was induced at 298 K by the addition of isopropyl
-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mM.
At 16 h post-induction the cells were harvested by centrifugation,
suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 40 mg ml 1 hen
egg-white lysozyme, subjected to two cycles of freezing and thawing
and sonicated until the lysate was homogeneous. Centrifugation of
these lysates at 10 000g for 20 min yielded inclusion bodies.</p>
      <p>The inclusion bodies were washed four times with a buffer
consisting of 20 mM Tris?HCl pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5%
Triton X-100 and 1 mM DTT and were dissolved in a buffer consisting
of 50 mM MES?NaOH pH 6.0, 8 M urea, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM
DTT. This mixture was slowly rotated overnight at 277 K before
centrifugation at 10 000g for 20 min to remove insoluble materials.
The yields of inclusion bodies were 0.1 g for nectin-1-EC and 0.2 g
for nectin-2-EC per litre of culture.</p>
      <p>Unfolded proteins were refolded by 300-fold dilution into
refolding solution A [500 mM l-arginine, 100 mM Tris?HCl pH 9.0,
2 mM oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and 1 mM reduced glutathione
(GSH)] in the case of nectin-1-EC or refolding solution B (500 mM
l-arginine, 100 mM Tris?HCl pH 9.0, 10 mM GSSG, 0.1 mM GSH)
in the case of nectin-2-EC, followed by incubation for 48 h at 277 K.
After concentration using a 10 000 molecular-weight cutoff
ultrafiltration membrane (GE Healthcare), the samples were subjected to
size-exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg
column (GE Healthcare) to separate correctly folded proteins from
aggregated forms. These fractions were dialyzed against 20 mM MES
pH 6.0 to precipitate almost-misfolded proteins, filtered using an
Ultrafree-MC GV 0.22 mm (Millipore) and applied onto a HiTrap SP
HP column (5 ml; GE Healthcare) followed by a Mono Q column
(1 ml; GE Healthcare). The protein yields were 0.5 mg for
nectin-1EC and 10 mg for nectin-2-EC from 100 mg inclusion bodies.
2.2. Optimization of refolding conditions and protein purification</p>
      <p>The standard conditions for refolding nectin-1-EC and nectin-2-EC
were as follows: 400 mM l-arginine, 100 mM Tris?HCl pH 9.0,
2.5 mM GSH, 2.5 mM GSSG and 100 mg ml 1 unfolded protein.
Small-scale refolding assays (1 ml) were performed to investigate the
effects of changing the l-arginine concentration from 100 to 600 mM
(for nectin-1-EC), the pH from 7.0 to 9.0 (for nectin-1-EC), the
GSSG:GSH ratio from 10.0:0.1 mM to 0.1:10.0 mM (for both
nectin1-EC and nectin-2-EC) and the concentration of unfolded protein
from 25 to 200 mg ml 1 (for nectin-1-EC). In each case, the unfolded
protein solutions were diluted at least 300-fold into each of the
refolding solutions such that only one parameter was varied while the
other parameters were kept at the standard conditions.</p>
      <p>The solutions were incubated at 277 K for 48 h and then subjected
to size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL
column using an A¨KTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare; Figs. 1a?1d).
A peak at an elution volume of 15.5 ml corresponded to the
correctly folded protein containing native intramolecular disulfide
bonds. Aggregates containing intermolecular disulfide bonds eluted
in the void volume ( 8.5 ml).
2.3. Crystallization</p>
      <p>Purified nectin-1-EC and nectin-2-EC were dialyzed against
solutions C (20 mM Tris?HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) and D (20 mM Tris?
HCl pH 9.0, 150 mM NaCl), respectively, and then concentrated to 5
and 4 mg ml 1, respectively, using a Vivaspin 6 10k (GE Healthcare).
The homogeneous proteins were analyzed by screening additives
using dynamic light scattering with a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern
Instruments) to determine their suitability for crystallization. In the
presence of 0.2 M NDSB201 nectin-1-EC and nectin-2-EC were
monodisperse. Initial crystallization trials were performed using a
Phoenix liquid-handling system (Art Robbins Instruments) at 296 K
using SaltRx 1, SaltRx 2, 50%(v/v) (half concentration) PEGRx 1,
50%(v/v) PEGRx 2, 50%(v/v) PEG/Ion 1 and 50%(v/v) PEG/Ion 2.
The volume of the reservoir solution was 60 ml. The drops consisted
of 0.2 ml of both the protein and reservoir solution.</p>
      <p>In the presence of 0.4 M NDSB201, nectin-1-EC and nectin-2-EC
crystals were obtained using both polyethylene glycol and salt
conditions as the reservoir. The initial crystallization conditions for
nectin-1-EC and nectin-2-EC were further refined by changing the
pH, precipitant concentration and additives. The most promising
crystals of nectin-1-EC were observed in drops comprised of equal
volumes of nectin-1-EC solution [20 mM Tris?HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM
NaCl and 6%(w/v) 1,6-hexanediol] and precipitant solution [50 mM
citric acid, 50 mM bis-Tris propane and 1?3%(v/v) PEG 3350] at
296 K (Fig. 2a). Crystals of nectin-1-EC could be obtained even if the
crystallization conditions contained no NDSB201, and the NDSB201
did not influence the diffraction quality of the crystals. The most
promising crystals of nectin-2-EC were observed in drops comprised
of equal volumes of nectin-2-EC solution (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.0,
150 mM NaCl and 0.35 M NDSD201) and precipitant solution
2.4. Data collection</p>
      <p>To improve the diffraction quality of the nectin-1-EC crystals, the
crystals were subjected to dehydration with increasing concentrations
of PEG 300. The crystals were transferred in a large number of steps
from harvesting buffer [20 mM Tris?HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
6%(w/v) 1,6-hexanediol, 50 mM citric acid, 50 mM bis-Tris propane
and 5%(v/v) PEG 3350] to harvesting buffer including 25%(v/v) PEG
300 at 277 K. Before freezing with liquid nitrogen, the crystals were
equilibrated in the final buffer for 3 d. This procedure markedly
improved the resolution limit of the crystals from 5 to 2.8 A?.
The nectin-2-EC crystals were soaked in a cryoprotection solution
consisting of 20 mM Tris?HCl pH 9.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.4 M
NDSB201, 45 mM citric acid, 55 mM bis-Tris propane, 4.0 M sodium
nitrate and 14%(v/v) ethylene glycol by stepwise transfer at room
temperature.</p>
      <p>
        Diffraction data sets were collected from nectin-1-EC and
nectin2-EC crystals on the BL44XU beamline at the SPring-8 synchrotron
facility (Harima, Hyogo, Japan) at 100 K using a DIP6040
imagingplate detector (MAC Science/Bruker AXS). A total of 60 frames of
data were collected for nectin-1-EC in three runs with a translation
of 70 mm along the rotation axis. The nectin-1-EC data-collection
parameters included a crystal-to-detector distance of 540 mm, an
oscillation angle of 0.5 and an exposure time of 20 s per frame at a
wavelength of 0.9000 A? (Fig. 3a). For nectin-2-EC, a total of 70
frames of data were collected with a crystal-to-detector distance of
400 mm, an oscillation angle of 0.5 and an exposure time of 2 s per
frame at a wavelength of 0.9000 A? (Fig. 3b). All data sets were
processed and scaled with the HKL-2000 program package
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(Otwinowski &amp; Minor, 1997)</xref>
