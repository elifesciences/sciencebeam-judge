        <p>We evaluated 35 cases of a mechanical approach to abdominal wall lifting, used in office-based gasless laparoscopic sterilization under local anesthesia. Lifting of the abdominal wall, using the camera trocar as an anchoring device and complemented by suprapubic lifting by means of a towel clamp, led to passive intra-abdominal air filling, giving sufficient space to identify, anesthetize, coagulate and cut the Fallopian tubes. Only mild sedation was necessary. All women walked to and from the operating room. All had successful tubal ligation. The overall satisfaction rate was 97%. The mechanical lifting moment was not painful. With the exception of one woman with failed tubal anesthesia, all women had a low mean pain score of 2.6 (VAS 010). No complications occurred except one wound infection. The costs were £ 1/4 of those of traditional laparoscopic sterilization and office hysteroscopic sterilization. This approach is effective for office-based laparoscopic sterilization. Room air, two strings and a needle replace active gas insufflation and narcosis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Modern healthcare is expensive, especially surgery
performed in a regular operating theatre. General
anesthesia involves life-threatening risks and
undesirable side-effects. Local anesthesia minimizes these
drawbacks and can be administered by the surgeon.
This promotes simplification.</p>
      <p>
        Female sterilization in an office situation using
laparoscopy with a low-pressure pneumoperitoneum
administered under local anesthesia has been
performed for more than 30 years (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ), but has not gained
widespread popularity. A survey of the American
Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ) showed
that only 5.1% of its members performed
officebased laparoscopy under local anesthesia. This is a
low incidence for doctors with a special interest in
laparoscopy. One explanation can be that active
insufflation of gas gives too much pain and necessitates
heavy conscious sedation and surveillance by specially
trained personnel (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ). Even a low-pressure
pneumoperitoneum is painful. By contrast, a zero-pressure
(gasless) pneumoperitoneum is painless.
Officebased laparoscopy and gasless laparoscopy are not
new procedures, but gasless laparoscopy under local
anesthesia is a new procedure. Two articles have
been published on gasless laparoscopic female
sterilization but these operations were done under
general anesthesia (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4 ref5">4,5</xref>
        ).
      </p>
      <p>
        Carbon dioxide gas is cold, very dry, dissolves in
water and provokes hypothermia, desiccation, tissue
irritation, and acid?base and blood gas changes. By
comparison, room air is warmer, humid, insoluble,
not irritating and available everywhere. Gasless
laparoscopy depends on mechanical lifting of the
abdominal wall with a passive inflow of room air. An open
access technique for trocar insertion is safer than a
closed access technique and is therefore a better
choice for office laparoscopy (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ). The open access
technique results in a 1.5?2 cm wide hole in the
abdominal wall, so using a micro-laparoscope is
meaningless. An ordinary laparoscope has advantages
in focal distance and field of vision.
      </p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>Material and methods</title>
      <p>This was a prospective pilot study to evaluate a
mechanical approach to lifting, used for
officebased gasless laparoscopic sterilization. Women
with a body mass index (BMI) &lt; 30 kg/m2, no serious
illnesses and no known abdominal adhesions were
informed about general and local anesthesia during
presterilization counseling sessions. All women
without contraindications for office surgery chose local
anesthesia and were given written information about
the procedure. Between September 2003 and
December 2005, 35 women were sterilized in a low resource
setting situated one floor below a regular operating
theatre. These women had a mean age of 39 years
(range 27?48), BMI 24.1 kg/m2 (19?30). Fourteen
women had had a previous abdominal operation. All
women but one had a normal-sized uterus. The
procedure room had resuscitation equipment
including oxygen and suction, an emergency tray with
diazepam (5 mg/ml), atropine (1 mg/ml), catastrophic
adrenaline (0.1 mg/ml) and a narcotic antidote,
electrocardiography equipment, pulse oximeter and an
alarm button.</p>
      <p>Women had fasted for at least 6 hours and were
premedicated orally with 200 mg ibuprofen and 1 g
paracetamol/30 mg codeine phosphate about 1 hour
before the start of surgery. After voiding, each patient
walked to the procedure room where she was given
intravenous fluid. Personnel included the surgeon,
an assistant to arrange the instruments and a midwife
to monitor the patient?s blood pressure, pulse rate,
respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation,
electrocardiogram, level of sedation and to give medications on
request from the surgeon. Only the surgeon was
dressed in sterile clothing. The patient was cleaned
by the assistant and draped by the surgeon and
mildly sedated with 5 mg diazepam and 25 mg
meperidine: doses that could be repeated once.
The muscle relaxant effect of diazepam was of value
in the mechanical stretching of the abdominal wall.
A mixture of 40 ml 1% lidocaine hydrochloride/
adrenaline and 60?80 ml 0.9% sterile NaCl was
used for local anesthesia. The anterior region of
the cervical portio was anesthetized and a Hulka
forceps attached. The abdominal wall just beneath
the umbilicus was anesthetized and a ? 12.5-mm
trocar was inserted into the abdominal wall using
an open access technique. The lifting technique used
the camera trocar as an anchoring device in the
abdominal wall. The open trocar gas inlet allowed
a free inflow of room air. An operative (0 , 10 mm)
laparoscope with a 6-mm working channel was used.
The trocar/abdominal wall were lifted with a loop of
polydioxanone suture (PDS # 1) snared around the
shaft of the trocar with a hang knot and
needledriven through the fascia, cutaneous tissue and
skin in the lower end of the abdominal wall incision.
The loop suture was attached to a horizontal metal
arm mounted on the operating table and placed
above the woman.</p>
      <p>Padded shoulder supports were an important
prerequisite, because if a woman were to slide
downwards on the table she would be likely to get scared
and tense her abdominal muscles to stay put. This
would tend to press the intestines into the pelvis.
However, despite the shoulder supports it was
necessary for the women to lie with their pelvic region
10 cm outside the table. This position gave necessary
sliding distance to prevent the Hulka forceps from
being blocked by the table when it was placed in steep
Trendelenburg position.</p>
      <p>
        Mechanical lifting of the abdominal wall with the
camera trocar as an anchoring device and with
the trocar gas inlet open, led to passive filling of the
abdomen with air. Lifting the skin and subcutaneous
tissue 6?8 cm above the symphysis pubis in the same
way using a towel clamp allowed sufficient air into the
abdomen for laparoscopic sterilization. The
combination of mechanical lifting, the Trendelenburg position
and the forward rotation of the uterus created adequate
intra-peritoneal space to identify, anesthetize,
coagulate and cut the tubes. If the mechanical lifting
procedure did not create sufficient space to identify the
tubes, a small amount of additional room air (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ) was
insufflated actively using a rubber bulb. A towel clamp
closing the upper end of the abdominal wall incision
then secured air tightness. The mechanical lifting
supported most of the weight of the abdominal wall
and only a small volume of actively insufflated air and a
low intra-abdominal pressure increase were needed to
create additional space. After the tubes had been
anesthetized, coagulated, divided with hook-scissors
and the intra-peritoneal air been reduced to a
minimum, the abdominal wall opening was closed. The
women were able to sit up for a minute and then walk
back to the recovery room.
      </p>
      <p>All women received postoperative information from
the surgeon or the midwife. They were given oral
medication for 2 days (200 mg ibuprofen 3 and 1 g
paracetamol/30 mg codeine phosphate 3) and a
questionnaire to be sent back in 1 week (pain score,
worst painful moment, satisfaction rate,
complications, validity of the presterilization counseling
session).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>Results</title>
      <p>All women had a successful tubal ligation. The
overall satisfaction rate was 97%. Two of the first
10 women in the study had a small amount of filtered
room air insufflated actively, but when the camera
trocar lifting procedure was complemented by
suprapubic lifting, there was no need for active air filling
because the intra-abdominal laparoscopic view was
always good. No woman reported the mechanical
lifting moment to be painful: one stating, ?It was like
being lifted in the pants?. Thirty-four of 35 women
were satisfied in that they answered ?yes? to the
question of whether they would recommend the
same operation to their best friend. One woman
was not satisfied; the reason was much pain when
one of the tubes was electro-coagulated. This was the
only woman to report that the interprocedural pain
was worse than was expected from the information
given in the presterilization counseling. Per/
postoperative pain was measured using a visual 0?
10 analog scale (VAS). The 34 satisfied women
reported an average score of 2.6 (range 0?7.5) and
three expressed no pain at all. The potentially painful
moments during the operation were the different
needle pinpricks, the Hulka forceps manipulations,
unintentional rough touching of pelvic organs and
anesthetic failure. One woman reported VAS 7.5 for
the steep Trendelenburg position and one woman
VAS 7.0 for the Hulka forceps application. Minor
sedation was sufficient. All women walked to and
from the operating room. No operation was
converted to general anesthesia and there were no
complications except for one wound infection. All
women left for home after 1?5 hours and all
submitted a completed outcome questionnaire.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the first 10 operations, a 1.2-mm puncture needle
was used for tubal anesthesia. This needle had a
tendency to push the tube in front of itself rather
than to penetrate. Later, a 0.4-mm needle was used.
When using a 10-mm laparoscope, a ?12.5 mm
camera trocar with an open high-flow gas inlet is necessary
for the free passive inflow of room air. A smaller trocar
can reduce the inflow of air, and result in a negative
intra-abdominal pressure, that limits the space for
inspection and instrumentation and causes pain.
The used mechanical lifting procedure has a short
setup time (&lt; 1?2 min), introduces no extra devices
into the peritoneal cavity, causes no trauma to the
peritoneal surface and does not interfere with surgical
movements.</p>
      <p>To further simplify the process, the surgeon can use
an amnioscope (20 200 25 mm), which permits
direct visual inspection and instrumentation of the
tubal areas (Figure 1). Short instruments are then
used for an optimal visual distance. Since 1993, the
author has performed more than 200 female
sterilizations using an amnioscope. The only drawback
compared to using a laparoscope are a less comfortable
working position for the surgeon and the fact that the
personnel and patient cannot watch the procedure on
a monitor. An amnioscope with or without an
operative laparoscope is a good choice, that supports a
high inflow of room air and to insert a second working
instrument beside the laparoscope to displace
obscuring loops of distended bowel, if any.</p>
      <p>
        Using an amnioscope and operate under local
anesthesia and mild sedation in an office setting
conforms well to the statement of the WHO Task Force
on Female Sterilization (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ). ?The ideal female
sterilization would involve a simple, easily learned,
onetime procedure that could be accomplished under
local anesthesia and involve a tubal occlusion
technique that caused minimum damage. The procedure
would be safe, have high efficacy, be readily
accessible, and be personally and culturally acceptable. The
cost for each procedure would be low and there would
be minimal costs for the maintenance of equipment?.
      </p>
      <p>
        In developing countries, where minilaparotomy is a
common approach, women would probably benefit
from this amnioscope lifting procedure. Compared
with minilaparotomy, it gives a much better view of
the pelvic organs, an aesthetically more acceptable
scar, a shorter recovery period and less complications/
complaints (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ). Using an ordinary anesthesia frame in
the lifting process, with the horizontal arm draped in a
sterile sleeve, makes the procedure progress even
more smoothly. In developing countries, where
resources are limited for the purchase and
maintenance of more sophisticated laparoscopic equipment,
this amnioscope lifting procedure is truly a cheaper
and safer option for female sterilization than the
traditional laparoscopic procedure presently used in
the developed world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Office laparoscopic sterilization requires, in
contrast to office hysteroscopic sterilization, no
scheduling of surgery according to the woman?s menstrual
cycle and has an almost 100% first-attempt success
rate, an immediate effect on fertility, no need for tubal
patency control, no material costs, a reversal success
rate of 55?75% (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        ), an unchanged possibility of IVF
and can be performed within 48 hours of delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Office laparoscopy is claimed to cost much less than
traditional laparoscopy. In one study, there was an
almost 80% reduction in costs (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ), which is in
agreement with the present study. Our total costs in
2006 were calculated to be NOK 2,895 (US $446),
which represents a 75% reduction. Gasless
laparoscopic sterilization and hysteroscopic sterilization
(Essure device) can both be done in an
officebased setting with the same OR-team and operation
time. The Essure procedure is however approximately
US $1,575 more expensive due to additional costs for
the Essure devices (ESS305, Conceptus, Inc., USA,
Retail Price: $1,299) and for tubal occlusion control
(HSG US $275) and is contraindicated within 6 weeks
after delivery and in women with hypersensitivity to
nickel or allergy to contrast media.
      </p>
      <p>
        A comparative study/literature review of
hysteroscopic sterilization versus laparoscopic tubal
sterilization (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
        ) showed overall standard complication rates
for laparoscopic sterilization of 0.8?0.9% (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6 ref9">6,9</xref>
        ) and a
major complication rate for hysteroscopic sterilization
of 3.2% (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
        ). Moreover, correct use of local anesthesia
removes the single greatest source of risk in
conventional laparoscopic sterilization procedures, general
anesthesia.
      </p>
      <p>
        A gastight mechanical lifting procedure, that
creates adequate intra-peritoneal space for female
sterilization under local anesthesia, is also useful in
surgery under general anesthesia. Therefore, in
conventional gas laparoscopy, the author also uses the
described lifting technique. Such lift-assisted
laparoscopy makes surgery in low gas pressure (1?
6 mm Hg) possible with sustained optimal or
adequate view (
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ) and, in case of need, to take
temporary measures in a ?gasless? condition. An immediate
shift between low, standard and zero gas pressure is
possible. With no gas pressure, conventional open
surgery instruments such as clamps, scissors and
powerful suction devices can be used and with
standard gas pressure, the complementary abdominal wall
lifting means a ?double? outcome in forming the
intraabdominal space. A special slit-trocar facilitates the
shifting maneuver between the gas-based and gasless
technique (Figure 2). The finding that the centrally
positioned camera trocar, except for its normal
function as a gastight sleeve for the laparoscope, is also a
perfect anchoring device for mechanical lifting, is an
enhancement for laparoscopic surgery. ?Yesterdays?
gasless laparoscopy must not be confused with
liftassisted laparoscopy. The European Association for
Endoscopic Surgery states that ?gasless laparoscopy
has no clinically relevant advantages compared to
low-pressure (5?7 mm Hg) pneumoperitoneum?
(
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
        ). There may be two exceptions to this: laparoscopy
under local anesthesia and lift-assisted laparoscopy
under general anesthesia if it is required to use a
conventional open surgery instrument. All patients
benefit from low-pressure gas laparoscopy and
especially high-risk patients, including pregnant women.
      </p>
      <p>The evaluated mechanical lifting technique can be
applied effectively in office laparoscopic sterilization,
even to overweight women. Risks of general
anesthesia and active gas insufflation are eliminated and room
air, two strings and a needle, replace a CO2 gas filling
machine and narcosis.</p>
